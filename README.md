# A simple tree-based classifier

I guess that's pretty self-explanatory.

## Building

Assuming you have the standard c development environment (standard libraries - stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h and math.h - and gcc) and your system supports the `make` command, simply open the root directory on your terminal and run `make`.

Otherwise, run `gcc -o treetest src/treeClassifier.c src/treeTest.c -lm -Wall -Werror -g`.
